# Lab_5_Graphs
This lab provides 2 types of graph structure: matrix and list. 3 modes provided: interactive, demo and 
benchmark(benchmark results are accesssible in separate file). Graph algorithms provided: dfs, bfs, find amount of connectivity components, 
find amount of cycles, lowest-cost path finding(Dijkstra algorithm), topological sort based on dfs, build spanning tree using dfs and
build minimum spanning tree(Dijkstra-Prim algorithm)
